##### Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/). We are committed to fostering an inclusive and respectful community.

#### How to Contribute

##### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please report it via GitHub Issues:

1. Check if the issue already exists in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/psqlmaster/gorgona/issues).
2. Create a new issue with a clear title (e.g., "Server crashes on invalid SEND command").
3. Include:
   - Steps to reproduce the bug.
   - Expected and actual behavior.
   - Environment details (OS, OpenSSL version, compiler).
   - Relevant logs (e.g., from `gorgonad.log`).
4. Use the provided issue template if available.

##### Suggesting Features

We welcome ideas for new features, such as replication or new subscription modes! To propose a feature:

1. Open a GitHub Issue with the label "enhancement."
2. Describe the feature, its use case, and potential implementation ideas.
3. Reference the [**"Future Plans"**](./readme.md#future-plans) section in readme.md if relevant.

##### Submitting Code Changes

To contribute code (bug fixes, features, or improvements):

1. Fork the repository and create a branch for your changes (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`).
2. Follow the [Coding Guidelines](#coding-guidelines) and ensure tests pass.
3. Commit your changes with clear messages (e.g., "Fix buffer overflow in SEND parsing").
4. Push to your fork and submit a pull request (PR) to the `main` branch.
5. Reference the related issue in your PR description (e.g., "Fixes #123").

##### Development Setup

To set up the development environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/psqlmaster/gorgona.git
   cd gorgona
   ```
2. Install dependencies (OpenSSL required):
   - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libssl-dev`
   - Fedora: `sudo dnf install openssl-devel`
   - REDOS: `sudo yum install openssl11 openssl11-devel`
   - macOS: `brew install openssl`
3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   make clean && make
   ```
4. Test your setup by running:
   ```bash
   ./gorgonad -h
   ./gorgona genkeys
   ```

##### Coding Guidelines

To maintain code quality and consistency:

- **Language**: Use C99 standard for compatibility.
- **Style**: Follow the [Linux Kernel Coding Style](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/coding-style.html) (tabs, 80-column limit, clear function names).
  - Run `clang-format` with the provided `.clang-format` file (if available) or use `indent -kr`.
- **Comments**: Use `/* */` for comments, in English, with clear explanations (e.g., `/* Parse SEND command, validate format */`).
- **Error Handling**: Always check return values (e.g., `fopen`, `malloc`) and log errors to `gorgona.log`.
- **Security**: Avoid buffer overflows, use `strncpy` over `strcpy`, and validate all inputs.
- **Logging**: Use UTC timestamps (`[YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ]`) via `get_utc_time_str` in `gorgonad.c`.

Example:
```c
/* Validate and parse SEND command */
if (strncmp(buffer, "SEND|", 5) != 0) {
    char time_str[32];
    get_utc_time_str(time_str, sizeof(time_str));
    fprintf(log_file, "%s Invalid command from %d: %.*s\n", time_str, sd, valread, buffer);
    fflush(log_file);
    return -1;
}
```

##### Testing

We aim for robust code with high test coverage:

1. Write unit tests for new functions in `tests/` using CMocka (planned, check issues for status).
2. Run existing tests (if any):
   ```bash
   make test
   ```
3. Test manually:
   - Generate keys: `./gorgona genkeys`
   - Send a message: `./gorgona send "2025-10-03 12:00:00" "2026-10-03 12:00:00" "Test" "hash.pub"`
   - Listen: `./gorgona listen single hash`
   - Check logs: `tail -f gorgona.log`
4. Ensure no memory leaks (use `valgrind`):
   ```bash
   valgrind --leak-check=full ./gorgonad
   ```

#### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code follows the [Coding Guidelines](#coding-guidelines).
2. Include tests for new functionality or bug fixes.
3. Update documentation (README.md, inline comments) if needed.
4. Submit your PR with a clear description, referencing issues (e.g., "Fixes #123: Add TLS support").
5. A maintainer will review your PR. Be ready to address feedback.
6. After approval, your changes will be merged into `main`.
